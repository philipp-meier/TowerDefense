# Contributing
First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this project!

If you want to contribute, please ensure, that you follow these rules:
1) Use only royalty-free assets.
2) Develop with the current software architecture in mind, or change it for the better.
3) Don't submit unused code.

If you want to make sure, that your pull request will be accepted, please contact me or create an issue, where
we can discuss the feature beforehand.

Feedback concerning the architecture and the project in general is very much appreciated, since Typescript is not my main programming
language and I am not a game developer at all.
